# Welcome to my user page!

## Who am I
I'm a hobbyist student who's been self taught in computer science for over half a decade. Though I spend a lot of time with higher level projects such as game engines and lighting simulations, I also tend to do a lot of lower-level work, such as writing pure x86 assembly driver code and designing processors.

My profile is unfortunately sparse, as I don't usually go through the effort of uploading my projects unless I'm intending to showcase them (something I'm meaning to work on!!), although sometimes my work is purely pen-and-paper while I'm working out how to solve a problem.

## What I use
I typically use vim on my personal machine with the GNU build tools. However, some of my projects are currently being hosted on my school-issued laptop (as I cannot carry my personal device thanks to the phone-banning bill in Texas), so any C/C++ projects are being done with the MSVC build tools in Visual Studio 2022. (Until late May of 2026!)

## What I'm working on

### 2/26/26
I'm currently working on a maskless photolithography machine (only designs right now), though I also have an unfinished 32-bit x86 kernel, Verilog CPU, Voxel game engine and Factory simulation game in the backlog. :')
